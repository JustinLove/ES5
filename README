# es5 - JavaScript/EcmaScript 5 in 3

While some of the best features of ES5 will never run in an ES3-only engine, it also adds some convenience methods which are perfectly possible to implement in current engines (or at least stub out in a tolerable way)

While  many of these functions are provided by the big JavaScript libraries, it's not always appropriate to the task to bring in the heavy hitters.
